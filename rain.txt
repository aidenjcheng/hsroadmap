ichigo... do you know how i hate rain? and it rains in this world, too. if your heart is troubled, the skies will become cloudy. if you grieve, it will rain ever so easily. i wonder if you can understand... the fear of being rained on in this lonely world... to stop that rain, i shall lend you any strength, any power. if you just have faith in me, i will not allow any rain to fall upon this world. trust me, ichigo. as long as i am here, you'll never fight alone.
